GEMiCal
=======

Simple Pure-Pascal GEM to display a calendar.

It is not very functional at the moment, it is very much an MVP.

Current functions:

1. displays a month with simple month or year navigation.
2. shows any event that either starts in, ends in or straddles the
   current month.
3. loads all the .ics files in a folder.
4. the ICS folder can be changed.

Contributions welcome.
