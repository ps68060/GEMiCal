GEMiCal
=======

Simple Pure-Pascal GEM to display a calendar.

It is not very functional at the moment, it is very much an MVP.

Current functions:

1. displays current month only
2. shows any event that either starts or ends in the current month
3. the ICS folder can be changed but the window does not redraw itself.

Contributions welcome.
