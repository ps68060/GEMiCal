GEMiCal
=======

Simple Pure-Pascal GEM to display a calendar.

It is not very functional at the moment, it is very much an MVP.

Current functions:

1. displays a month with simple month or year navigation.
2. shows any event that either starts in, ends in or straddles the
   current month.
3. the ICS folder can be changed but the window does not redraw itself.

Contributions welcome.
